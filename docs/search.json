Is it appropriate to round down? (conservative)\nMany schools are missing level over time, and some have conflicting levels (High School in 2011 and 2013 but Other/Ungraded in 2012). Can we impute standard levels across schools?\nHmong College Prep (and likely others) have some data quality issues (2010 has 100% hispanic students - assuming data entry error) - can we correct these instances?\nWhich free/reduced lunch/meausre do we use? Manual or the imputed values? Manual is more conservative.\nIs exposure index same as interaction index?"
