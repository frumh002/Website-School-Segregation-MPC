# Questions for the group

1. There seems to be conflicting information regarding what schools are metro vs. not?
2. Do we want to add all charter and private schools or are we only focused on private schools?
3. Some school districts have common names (St. Paul Public School District vs. Sain Paul Public Schools | Eden Prairie vs. Eden Paririe Public School District | etc.) - do we merge these or are they separate districts?
4. The total enrollment seems to be a decimal. Is it appropriate to round down? (conservative)
5. Many schools are missing level over time, and some have conflicting levels (High School in 2011 and 2013 but Other/Ungraded in 2012). Can we impute standard levels across schools?
6. Hmong College Prep (and likely others) have some data quality issues (2010 has 100% hispanic students - assuming data entry error) - can we correct these instances?
7. Which free/reduced lunch/meausre do we use? Manual or the imputed values? Manual is more conservative.
8. Is exposure index same as interaction index?
