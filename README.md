# Twin Cities School Sergregation Descriptive Report

It is coded in R and thus far uses the following datasets:
- Stanford NCES 1991-2022 Dataset (found here: )
- Stanford Segregation 1991-2022 Dataset (found here: https://edopportunity.org/segregation/data/downloads/#segregation-1)

Here is an overview of the structure of this project and the associated R scripts:
- Import and format NCES data (importnces.R)
- Build out the school segregation descriptive file (schoolsegbuild.R)
- School segregation descriptive analysis (schoolsegdesc.qmd)
- School segregation index analysis (schoolsegindex.qmd)
- Ecological analysis (ecological.qmd)

School segregation is a district level measure, but we might need to use school-level % minority. Exposure to concentrated poverty as a measure. 

We have to prove two things to the court:
1. School segregation is a substantial factor in school/educational adequacy (the state has a duty to provide an adequate education). Adequacy is not defined per se. Adequacy: low test scores, poor outcomes (health, etc.), high school graduation rates.
2. 

National patterns vs. MN patterns of school segregation.

Can we replicate basic descriptive stats to see if MN operates similar to other cities? The same causal pathways exist in MN.

Within school districts, do schools significantly differ in our outcome measures as exposure to segregation (% BIPOC) increase (stratify by poverty proxy)?
- How does this same analysis compare to other metro cities in the US?

Tell the story of what happens when we segregate kids into schools. Fewer opportunities, fewer high level classes. Counterfactual set of districts that moved in a separate direction around the US.

School closures data.
